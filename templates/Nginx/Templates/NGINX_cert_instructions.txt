 # Configuring SSL certificate for NGINX server

      This version of NGINX application uses pre-generated certificate which is self-signed and is meant to be
      only a temporary solution just to exemplify SSL/TLS configuration.

      Generate a new self-signed certificate for your NGINX server using `openssl` command
      or use a signed certifcate that you already own.

      For example, if you would like to generate self-signed certifcate and private key
      you could run the following command:
      ```
      openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout https1.key -out https1.cert
      ```

      Configure your own certificate using the following command:
      ```
      export CERT_FILE=https1.cert
      export KEY_FILE=https1.key
      export APP_INSTANCE_NAME=<name of your NGINX instance, e.g. nginx-1>
      export NAMESPACE=<name of your Kurbernetes namespace, e.g. default>

      # using --dry-run option because we update existing secret resource
      # if we used kubectl create... for existing secret we would get an error
      kubectl --namespace nginx create secret generic nginx-1-nginx-secret \
        --from-file=$CERT_FILE --from-file=$KEY_FILE \
        --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
      ```
      where .cert is a file containing SSL certificate and .key file contains private part of it.

      Run these commands to restart all Pods without causing a downtime
      ```
      PODS=$(kubectl get pods --namespace nginx -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nginx-1 | awk 'FNR>1 {print $1}')

      TIMEOUT=60

      for i in ${PODS[@]}; do
        echo "Deleting Pod: $i..."
        kubectl delete pod $i --namespace nginx
        echo "Sleeping for $TIMEOUT seconds..."
        sleep $TIMEOUT
      done
      ```
