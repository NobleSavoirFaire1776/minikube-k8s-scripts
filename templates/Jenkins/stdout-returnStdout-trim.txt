I have something like this on a Jenkinsfile (Groovy) and I want to record the stdout and the exit code in a variable in order to use the information later.

sh "ls -l"

How can I do this, especially as it seems that you cannot really run any kind of groovy code inside the Jenkinsfile?




The latest version of the pipeline sh step allows you to do the following;

// Git committer email
GIT_COMMIT_EMAIL = sh (
    script: 'git --no-pager show -s --format=\'%ae\'',
    returnStdout: true
).trim()
echo "Git committer email: ${GIT_COMMIT_EMAIL}"

Another feature is the returnStatus option.

// Test commit message for flags
BUILD_FULL = sh (
    script: "git log -1 --pretty=%B | grep '\\[jenkins-full]'",
    returnStatus: true
) == 0
echo "Build full flag: ${BUILD_FULL}"

These options where added based on this  (https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-26133) issue.

See official documentation for the sh command. (https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#sh-shell-script)
