#The fsck (File System Consistency Check) Linux utility checks filesystems for errors or outstanding issues. The tool is used to fix potential errors and generate reports.

#The fsck tool can be used in various situations:

            Use fsck to run a filesystem check as preventive maintenance or when there is an issue with your system.
            One common problem fsck can diagnose is when the system fails to boot.
            Another one is when you get an input/output error when the files on your system become corrupt.
            You can also use the fsck utility to check the health of external drives, such as SD cards or USB flash drives.


#The basic syntax for the fsck utility follows this pattern:
fsck <options> <filesystem>

#How to Check and Repair Filesystem

##There are a few steps to do before you check and repair your file system. You need to locate a device and unmount.

##View Mounted Disks and Partitions

####To view all mounted devices on your system and check disk location, use one of the available tools in Linux.

####One method to locate the disk you want to scan is to list the filesystem disks with the df command:

df -h

#To view partitions for your first disk, for example, use the following command:
sudo parted /dev/sd<x> 'print'

#Unmount the Disk

##Before you can run a disk check with fsck, you need to unmount a disk or partition. If you try to run fsck on a mounted disk or partition, you will get a warning:
####Make sure to run the unmount command:

sudo umount /dev/sd<x>


#Run fsck to Check for Errors

##Now that you unmounted the disk, you can run fsck. To check the second disk, enter:

sudo fsck -M /dev/sdb


#Mount the Disk

##When you finish checking and repairing a device, mount the disk so you can use it again.

####In our case, we will remount the sdb disk:

mount /dev/sdb


#Do a Dry Run with fsck

##Before you perform a live check, you can do a test run with fsck. Pass the -N option to the fsck command to perform a test:

sudo fsck -M -N /dev/sdb

####The output prints what would happen but does not perform any actions.



#Skip Fsck on Mounted Filesystems

##To make sure you do not try to run fsck on a mounted filesystem, add the -M option. This flag tells the fsck tool to skip any mounted filesystems.

####To show you the difference, we will run fsck on sdb while it is mounted, and then when we unmount it.

sudo fsck -M /dev/sdb

####The output of fsck tool to skip any mounted filesystems.

####While sdb is mounted, the tool exits without running a check. Then, we unmount sdb and run the same command again. This time, fsck checks the disk and reports it as clean, or with errors.




#####Run fsck on Linux Root Partition#####

As we already mentioned, fsck cannot check root partitions on a running machine since they are mounted and in use. However, even Linux root partitions can be checked if you boot into recovery mode and run the fsck check:

1. To do so, power on or reboot your machine through the GUI or by using the terminal:

sudo reboot

2. Press and hold the shift key during boot-up. The GNU GRUB menu appears.

3. Select Advanced options for Ubuntu.

Linux recovery mode screen.

4. Then, select the entry with (recovery mode) at the end. Let the system load into the Recovery Menu.

5. Select fsck from the menu.

Linux recovery menu select fsck tool.

6. Confirm by selecting <Yes> at the prompt.

Recovery mode confirmation message when fsck is selected.

7. Once finished, select resume at the recovery menu to boot up the machine.
