This would probably never be the BEST approach to something, but I'm wondering if it's even possible.

Something like:

awk '/function_i_want_to_call/,/^$/{print}' script_containing_function | xargs source

function_i_want_to_call arg1 arg2 arg3

Except actually working.





First you need to rigorously determine what command will produce the specific part you want to source. For a trivial example, given the file

var1=value1
var2=value2

you could set only var1 using head -n1 filename. This could be a pipeline of arbitrary complexity, if you wanted.

Then run:

source <( pipeline_of_arbitrary_complexity some_filename )

Works only in bash. To do it in POSIX, I think you'd need to make a temp file.







In bash/ksh and similar, you can use <() to avoid the subshell that | creates:

insourcable.sh:

echo hallo welt
echo hello world
echo ahoj svÄ›te

Suppose you only want to in-source line number two:

. <( sed -n '2 p' < insourcable.sh )

(prints "hello world")
