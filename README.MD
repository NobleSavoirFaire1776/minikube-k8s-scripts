# PERSONAL GITHUB SCRIPTS 
## github.com/noblesavoirfaire1776minikube-k8s-scripts

# INTRO
This repository is pretty much a backup for scripts that I have written for fun, for effective administration, ease of use, quasi-automation, and learning.  Some of these files are scripts that will work off the bat for anyone, some need to be manually configured, and others are just simple quick tools for an admin in-need!  :)


# What This Repository Can Bring You:
- Kubernetes/Minikube/Microk8s
- GCP Scripts
- Jenkinsfiles Templates
- Docker Scripts
- Dockerfiles, docker-compose Templates
- Ansible Scripts, Ansible Templates
- RELK configurations as templates for Redis, Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana
- YAML, BASH, JSON, Groovy
- Linux

# Overview
- There will always be more scripts to be added, modified, improved.
- This is an ongoing project, mainly to provide ease-of-use for myself at the end of the day, but I'm sure some of these scripts could teach and/or help a couple of folks out in the process! Spread the love, open-source community! <3
- ***NOTICE: A lot of these scripts are made strictly for my own personal environment(s), - I constantly aim to make them as universal as possible, but some are still in the works and some might not ever change.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND INEXPERIENCED USERS TO RUN SOME OF THESE SCRIPTS AS THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO POSSIBLY HARM ANOTHER ENVIRONMENT BY ACCIDENT.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!***

# New Goals:
- Aim to 'globalize' as many scripts as possible, mainly taking into consideration the pulling of environment variables and parsing data appropriately in between! hehe

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Overall Goal of This Project
Essentially, to back-up my scripts, but also to provide ideas, knowledge or insight into fellow participants into the open-source community that has given myself (and my family) so much!  I try hard, but this is all I can give back for now... I promise, I'll create greatness one day!  

# Credits:
To my brilliant, ever-hungry self for more knowledge, open-source communities, and everyone else involved who helps provide these amazing applications that we're gifted enough to be able to lay our fingertips upon!  =D
