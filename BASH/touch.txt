Shell command: touch
touch can be used to change a file's atime and mtime (but not to change its ctime).
-t specify a timestamp
-t can be used to specify a timestamp in [yy]yymmddhhmm[.ss] format.
In the following example, -t is combined with -a to change the access and -m to change the modification time.
stat with the %x and %y format is then used to verify if these dates were changed.

touch -m -t 201011121314.15 touched
touch -a -t 201211100908.07 touched

stat --format="Last access time:       %x"  touched
stat --format="Last modification time: %y"  touched
